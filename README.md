### Hi 👋

I’m a research scientist :scientist: working at [Zetta AI](zetta.ai), a startup that offers [neural circuit reconstruction](https://www.microns-explorer.org/cortical-mm3) technology to research groups. I've also been working on some independent research — most recently trying to extract 'connectomes' of [composition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#three-kinds-of-composition) values across large language models.

I often go by “Nick” (he/him).
