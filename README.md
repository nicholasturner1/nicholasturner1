### Hi 👋

I’m currently a member of the technical staff :scientist: at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/). I've also been working on some independent research — most recently trying to extract 'connectomes' of [composition](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html#three-kinds-of-composition) values across large language models.

I often go by “Nick” (he/him).
